# Notes:
 - What is a module.
   - Groups related tools together
   - Make it easy to know where to look for a particular tool
   - Common examples:
     - `matplotlib` (which creates charts)  
     - `pandas` (which loads tabular data)
     - `scikit-learn` (which performs machine learning)
     - `scipy` (which contains statistics functions) 
     - `nltk` (which works with text data)
    
 - We must import any modules that we plan on using before we can write any other code, If we don't import modules, we can't use the tools that they contain.

  - In this example, by importing the modules `pandas` and `matplotlib`, we're able to unbox the tools necessary to create a graph.
  - In this case, `pandas` gives us the tools to read data from a file, and `matplotlib` gives us the tools to plot the data.
