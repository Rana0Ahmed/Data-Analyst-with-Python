# Notes
## I
## Dictionaries :
 - To create the dictionary, you need curly brackets.
 - Dictionaries consists of key and values :
 ```
 dict = {key:'value', .......}
 ```
 
 
### Recap
 - keys in a dictionary should be so-called immutable objects.
 - To remove from dict use `del []`
 ```
 del(world['saeland'])
 #world is the name of dict
 ```
